Short info: This repository contains two plugins I've written as add-ons for the WordPress plugin Comic Easel. 
I've written them mostly for myself but they may be of interest to other people who have long form comics. There's no particular reason why they're two except I needed them like this for my site layout. see them in action at the.dreadfulgate.de.

1. This Story Widget: 
Creates a widget with some handy information for ongoing stories to show in the sidebar, such as the story title when it's not the page title as well, a synopsis and a link to the first page.

2. The Story so far: 
Adds a metabox to the comic upload page for a quick summary of what happened so far in the story. As well as a shortcode and a widget to display that. 

They're both in my own personal beta right now, but they're functional so feel free to use and/or adapt them. I'm currently working on some additional functions. Once I'm happy with those, I'll submit them to WordPress. We're also planning on adding them to a future version of Comicpress itself.
